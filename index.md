{% include figure.html description="<em>Adiantum</em> has phylogeny<br/>in its veins!" url="/assets/img/200px-Adiantum.png" css="image-right noborder" width="200px" targeturl="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiantum" %}

Research in the P. Lewis lab ([Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.eeb.uconn.edu/), [University of Connecticut](https://www.uconn.edu/)) focuses on statistical methods for phylogenetics. 
Most recently, we've developed: (1) better ways of estimating the marginal likelihood,
which is used to compare competing Bayesian models; (2) prior distributions for tree
topologies that allow for polytomies, which increases efficiency of Bayesian inference
when there are few substitutions, and (3) ways to measure the amount of information 
in data, either about the tree topology or continuous model parameters.
