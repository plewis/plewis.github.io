## Analisa Milkey ##

Analisa started in the Ph.D. program at UConn in August, 2021. She
obtained her B.S. in Biological Sciences at the University of
California, Davis, in June 2020. While at UC Davis, Analisa studied
convergent evolution in morphology associated with transitions to
selective zooplanktivory in butterfly fishes in the lab of [Peter
Wainwright](https://fishlab.ucdavis.edu).

## Paul O. Lewis ##
Paul is a Professor of [Ecology and Evolutionary
Biology](https://eeb.uconn.edu) at the [University of
Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut).
Although much of his professional training was in the area of flowering
plant systematics, specifically the evolution and biogeography of the
North American genus _Polygonella_, his research now focuses primarily
on statistical phylogenetics theory and methodology.

Paul grew up in the Inner [Bluegrass
Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluegrass_region) of Kentucky and
obtained his B.S. in Biology and Mathematics from [Georgetown
College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_College), Georgetown,
KY, in 1982. He obtained his M.S. degree in Biology from the [University
of Memphis](https://www.memphis.edu) in 1984 (advisor: Edward T. Browne,
Jr.), performing a floristic study of [Haywood County,
Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haywood_County,_Tennessee). He
earned a Ph.D. in Plant Biology from [The Ohio State
University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University) in 1991
(advisor: Daniel J. Crawford). 

Paul went on to do postdoctoral work at [North Carolina State
University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
North_Carolina_State_University) (advisor: Bruce Weir; honorary advisor:
Jeff Thorne), and in the Laboratory of Molecular Systematics,
[Smithsonian
Institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution)
(advisor: David L. Swofford). 

He came to UConn after 3 years as an Assistant Professor in the Biology
Department at the [University of New
Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_Mexico) in
Albuquerque, NM.

## Former lab members ##

### Suman Neupane ###

Suman started working toward his Ph.D. here in January, 2013, after
completing much of his dissertation research at Old Dominion University.
He completed his Ph.D. in December, 2016, and continued on at UConn for
another year as a postdoctoral researcher in the lab.

He studies flowering plants related to the genus _Hedyotis_ (family
Rubiaceae, the coffee family), which those in the eastern United States
will recognize as the small blue flowers known as bluets carpeting
roadsides and lawns in early spring. Hedyotis has a wide global
distribution, however, and, in addition to resolving the phylogeny and
biogeography of this group, Suman is interested in the tendency of
_Hedyotis_ to evolve secondary woodiness in tropical montane islands,
which mimics the evolution of secondary woodiness common in oceanic
island systems.

After leaving UConn, Suman was a postdoctoral researcher in [Josef Uyeda's laboratory at
Virginia Tech](http://www.uyedalab.com/). Suman began a tenure-track position 
in the Biology Department at [Murray State University](https://www.murraystate.edu) in Fall 2020. 

### Karolina Fučíková ###

Karolina Fučíková obtained her Ph.D. in the UConn EEB department
(advisor: Louise A. Lewis) on the systematics of chlorophyte green algae, and
later took the leading role in acquiring, characterizing and analyzing
green algal chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes for the GrAToL
(Assembling the Green Algal Tree of Life) and collaborated with other
Lewis lab members and statisticians in the UConn Statistics department
on the Bayesian Phylogenetic Information Content project.

Karolina is now an [Assistant Professor in Biology at Assumption College](https://www.assumption.edu/faculty-profile/dr-karolina-fu%C4%8D%C3%ADkov%C3%A1)
in Worcester, Massachusetts. You can reach her at [karolina.fucikova@gmail.com](karolina.fucikova@gmail.com).

### Yu (Daniel) Fan ###

Daniel obtained his Ph.D. from UConn in 2011 with a dissertation
entitled Bayesian phylogenetics, model selection, and methods of
detecting non-independent and heterotachous molecular evolution. He
obtained his undergraduate degree from the Ocean University of China in
Qingdao, and Master’s degree in Molecular Systematics from the Institute
of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOCAS).

After leaving UConn, Daniel was a postdoctoral researcher in [Wenyi
Wang’s lab](http://faculty.mdanderson.org/Wenyi_Wang/Default.asp?SNID=1347362362) at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.

He is currently at [Philips Research North America](https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/locations/cambridge-north-america.html) in Cambridge, MA. You
can reach him at [daniel.y.fan@gmail.com](daniel.y.fan@gmail.com).

### Mark Holder ###

Mark was a postdoctoral research associate in the lab for 2 years. Mark
received his Ph.D. from the University of Texas, Austin, in 2001, and
moved on to a postdoctoral position with David Swofford (then at Florida
State University) in 2003. He is now an Associate Professor in the
[Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](http://www2.ku.edu/~eeb/) at the University of
Kansas. See [Mark’s web site](http://phylo.bio.ku.edu/) for more information.
