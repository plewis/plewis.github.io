Despite having a break week, I failed to get instructions together for you this week, so I thought perhaps it would be good for you to just watch [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/lcT0j_-ix-E?si=--5LM8NHMAZshOxS) of me talking about information content.
 
This is a talk I gave at the annual conference known as the [Evolution Meetings](https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/) in 2016 (I was past-president of the Society of Systematic Biologists, SSB, at the time and SSB is one of the 3 societies that sponsor the meetings).
 
You can feel free to skip the first 3 minutes of introduction. You have already heard me explain this, but you might find this video gives you a more in-depth look at how entropy and information are related. I also talk at the end about the problem that we are working on (but without providing the solution we are working on).
