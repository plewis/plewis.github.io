permalink: /evaluations/
---
Students will be given an opportunity to provide feedback on their course experience and instruction using the University's standard procedures, which are administered by the [Office of Institutional Research and Effectiveness (OIRE)](http://www.oire.uconn.edu/).

The University of Connecticut is dedicated to supporting and enhancing teaching effectiveness and student learning using a variety of methods. The Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) is just one tool used to help faculty enhance their teaching. The SET is used for both formative (self-improvement) and summative (evaluation) purposes.
 
Additional informal formative surveys and other feedback instruments may be administered within the course.
