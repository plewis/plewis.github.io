If illness prevents you from taking a lecture or lab exam/quiz, it is your responsibility to notify your lecture instructor ([Paul Lewis](mailto:paul.lewis@uconn.edu) or lab instructor ([Kris Anderson](mailto:kristin.b.anderson@uconn.edu)), respectively, as soon as possible, and definitely before the event takes place. You do not need to disclose the nature of your illness; however, you will need to work with your instructor to determine when (or whether) you will be able to take the exam.

If life circumstances are affecting your ability to focus on courses and your UConn experience, students can email the Dean of Students at [dos@uconn.edu](mailto:dos@uconn.edu) to request support. Regional campus students should email the Student Services staff at their home campus to request support and faculty notification.
