### Syllabus for Fall Semester 2022
_Last updated August 19, 2022_

[Scroll straight to this week in the schedule](#today)

### Description of the course 

This is a freshman-level introdution to the science of plants, emphasizing the anatomy, physiology, diversity, genetics, and evolution of green plants (including green algae). Because it is a general education course, there is considerable attention given to how science works, from hypothesis generation to design of experiments to test the predictions arising from hypotheses. As is traditional in introductory botany courses, some time is devoted to fungi, cyanobacteria, red algae, brown algae and diatoms, and slime molds, even though these organisms are now known to be distantly related to green plants.

### Course Learning Objectives

At the completion of this course, students will be able to:

* (LO1) apply hypothetico-deductive reasoning (i.e. scientific method) to ascertain objective truths about the natural world
* (LO2) explain basic anatomy (cell types, tissue systems, and organs of primary and secondary growth) of vascular plants
* (LO3) explain basic physiology (photosynthesis, water and food transport, photoperiodism, and the roles of major plant hormones) of vascular plants
* (LO4) compare and contrast the life cycles of exemplars from different groups (fungi, green algae, bryophytes, ferns, gymnoperms, angiosperms, etc.)
* (LO5) summarize the diversity and evolutionary history of plants (including green algae, bryophytes, seedless vascular plants, gymnosperms, and angiosperms) and identify evidence supporting an endosymbiotic origin of chloroplasts from cyanobacteria
* (LO6) explain why organisms traditionally consider plant-like (fungi, slime molds, seaweeds) are no longer considered plants
* (LO7) identify and describe major evolutionary innovations (embryos, branching sporophytes, vascular tissues, seeds, pollen, and carpels) that resulted in the diversity of plants today
* (LO8) explain nutrient and water cycles and, in particular, how plants have affected the global carbon cycle and the implications for climate change
* (LO9) conduct, analyze, and report and discuss results of experiments to test hypotheses about the physiology of plants (specifically transpiration, photosynthesis, and hormones)

### Common Curriculum Alignment

The Common Curriculum prepares students to tackle 21st-century challenges by combining coursework across disciplines to expand their worldviews, enhance their range of skills, and develop into critical, creative, emotionally intelligent, and interdisciplinary thinkers. The Curriculum is designed to help students learn to be versatile in a rapidly changing world; combine knowledge in innovative ways; apply learning strategies to new contexts, including their major; see local and global patterns and the interconnectedness of intellectual work; and appreciate how we need each other to tackle today’s challenges.

The University has defined student learning objective (what a student should know, be able to do, or attitudes/beliefs they should possess by the end of the course) for each Topic of Inquiry in the Common Curriculum. Each Common Curriculum course aligns to one or more of those objectives. The course’s student learning objectives align to the Common Curriculum objectives; course assessment (assignments, exams/quizzes, etc) align to both the course learning objectives and the Common Curriculum objectives.

BIOL 1110 satisfies the Common Curriculum [Scientific and Empirical Inquiry](https://commoncurriculum.senate.uconn.edu/scientific-and-empirical-inquiry/) Topic of Inquiry (TOI-6-lab). The following table lists specific learning objectives of TOI-6 (lab) courses and how they align to the learning objectives of, and assessments used in, this course.

| Topic of Inquiry | Common Curriculum Objective | Course student learning objective(s) | Course assessment(s) |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :------------------  |
| TOI-6            | 1. Students will be able to explain and appropriately use basic scientific language and concepts | LO2,LO3,LO4,LO5,LO6,LO7,LO8 | Laboratory quizzes, lecture exams |
| TOI-6            | 2. Students will be able to design or conduct an experiment or analysis suitable to test a scientific hypothesis and be able to interpret the results | LO1,LO9 | Laboratory exercises/reports |
| TOI-6            | 3. Students will be able to solve problems described verbally, graphically, symbolically, or numerically | LO2,LO3,LO4,LO5,LO9 | Laboratory reports, lecture exams |
| TOI-6 lab        | Through application-based experiences using the scientific method, students will be able to identify problems, make observations, analyze data, interpret data, and develop models or explanations | LO1, LO9 | Laboratory experiments and reports |

BIOL 1110 is also a **majors** course. It can be substituted for the core course BIOL 1108 in, for example, the EEB major. Thus, if you are not a science major, please do not expect this course to be taught at a non-majors level.

### Attendance in lab and lecture

Attending all lectures and labs is important because this is the only way to obtain the material on which you will be tested. 

### Due dates and late policy

You are expected to be present for all quizzes and exams and to turn in assignments on the dates listed in the course schedule above. Late assignments will be penalized 20% for every day beyond the deadline unless an extension is arranged at least 24 hours before the deadline. Makeup exams will only be given in cases of family emergencies or illness, and the lecture instructor must be consulted prior to the exam.

### Exams

There are two midterm lecture exams and one final exam in this course.

### Textbook and lab manual

* Plant Biology (3rd edition) by Linda Graham, James M. Graham, and Lee W. Wilcox. (The textbook is available only as a PDF and is not available in the UConn Bookstore; purchase it directly from [LJLM Press](https://www.ljlmpress.com/plant_biology.html))
* Introduction to Botany, Biology 1110 Laboratory Manual, University of Connecticut, 2022 (Chapters of the lab manual will be made available to you for free as needed as PDF files)

The purpose of the assigned textbook reading is to give you the material from a different perspective. This is important because sometimes one person's explanation of a subject does not work for all people. You are not expected to know everything in the chapters assigned. Concentrate your textbook reading on subjects that were discussed in lecture. If you know I discussed a topic, but you cannot understand the topic even after reading about it in the textbook, please come to see one of us during office hours or arrange some other time to meet with us. Some test questions will come from the textbook, so the assigned reading is important.

### Grade determination

_Note: this section may change before the semester begins_

The total number of points you can earn is 370. The lecture component accounts for 200 points and the lab accounts for the remaining 170.

Lecture        | Points
:------------- | :---------------
Exam 1         | 100
Exam 2         | 100
Final exam     | 100
 
The 2 highest scores from the 3 exams will be counted. If you missed an exam (for any reason) and were not able to make it up before the answer key was posted, that will be the exam that is dropped. Note that you **must take the final exam** (even if you did well on the first two exams).
 
Laboratory     | Points
:------------- | :---------------
Quizes         | 50
Transpiration  | 10
Photosynthesis | 10
Selection      | 30
Hormones       | 30
Climate change | 10
Participation  | 30

### Grading scale

If you earn at least the percentage of total points indicated in the table below, you will be given the corresponding letter grade. If you earn fewer than 60% of the total points, you will receive an F for the course:

Percentage | Letter grade
:--------: | :----------:
92% | A
90% | A-
88% | B+
82% | B
80% | B-
78% | C+
72% | C
70% | C-
68% | D+
62% | D
60% | D-

Note that you can find out where you stand at any point in the course using the [Grade Center in HuskyCT](https://huskyct.uconn.edu). **No adjustments will be made to your grade at the end of the semester**, and there is **no extra credit** to make up for poor exam/lab-report performance. It is thus very important to do as well as you can on every test and every assignment.

#### Final exam information

You can obtain the date and time of the final exam by following the directions on the [Registrar’s web site](https://registrar.uconn.edu/exams/).
You are required to be available for your exam and/or complete an assessment during the time stated in the Registrar's Office Schedule. If you have a conflict with this time you must visit the Office of Student Services and Advocacy to discuss the possibility of rescheduling this assessment.
