## First lecture exam (Friday, Sep. 30, 2022)

The first exam will be worth 100 points and will comprise at least 40 questions, many of which are multiple choice like the poll questions I've been giving you in class. (Note that the poll questions and answers are posted in the form of a pdf file in the Lecture section of the HuskyCT course web site.) Not all questions will be multiple choice, however. Expect some matching, fill in the blank, short answer, and figure-labeling kinds of questions also.

Note: this document will be updated after each lecture. Be sure to check back.

The exam will cover through photosynthesis.

Here are some things to consider when studying for this exam:

### There have been a _lot_ of terms!

Here are the terms I've introduced thus far. You should be able to briefly explain each of these structures or processes. If you don't remember what I said, look up the term in your text book. Most terms are associated with figures from the textbook, so finding the figure in the textbook and reading the figure caption is a good place to start.

* cell, cell membrane, mitochondrion, vacuole, plasmodesmata
* plastid, chloroplast, chromoplast, amyloplast
* nucleus, chromatin, chromosome, nuclear envelope
* primary cell wall, secondary cell wall, lignin, pit field, pit
* tissue, organ, organ system
* tissue systems: dermal (protoderm), vascular (procambium), ground (ground meristem)
* parenchyma, collenchyma
* sclerenchyma, sclereid, fiber
* xylem: vessel, vessel element, tracheid
* phloem: sieve tube, sieve tube element, sieve plate, companion cell
* vascular tissue, simple tissue, complex tissue
* shoot, bud, lateral/axillary bud, terminal bud,
* stem, node, internode, axil, lenticel
* leaf, blade, petiole
* leaf arrangement: alternate, opposite, whorled
* leaf complexity: simple, compound (pinnate, palmate)
* leaf venation: pinnate, palmate, dichotomous, parallel
* leaf anatomy: epidermis, mesophyll (spongy, palisade), vascular bundle=vein
* stomata: guard cells, sunken stomate, xerophyte, cuticle, trichome
* leaf modifications: tendril, spine, bract, bulb, pitcher (plant), (venus fly) trap, sticky hairs (sundews)
* primary growth, cotyledon, monocot, eudicot, cortex, pith, vascular bundle distribution in cross section
* SAM (shoot apical meristem)
* RAM (root apical meristem)
* stem modifications: thorn, corm, rhizome, cladophyll, tuber, stolon
* root morphology: root cap, root hair, region of elongation, region of maturation
* root anatomy: endodermis, pericycle, cortex, casparian strip, lateral root, apoplast route, symplast route
* vascular cambium, wood, bark
* bark: inner vs. outer
* wood: heartwood vs. sapwood, springwood vs. summerwood
* periderm: cork cambium, phelloderm, cork tissue
* sections: tangential vs. radial, plainsawn vs. quartersawn
* wood grain: vessels, vascular rays, annual rings
* diffusion vs. osmosis
* water potential, solute potential, pressure potential, megapascal
* isotonic, hypertonic, hypotonic
* turgid, flaccid, plasmolysis/plasmolyzed
* water potential gradient, relative humidity vs. water potential of atmosphere
* water: partial charge, cohesion
* guard cells: role of potassium ions (K+)
* sugar sources vs. sinks in plants
* pressure flow model for sugar transport in phloem, aphids
* polymers: monomers
* nucleic acids (DNA,RNA; nucleic acid monomers)
* polysaccharides (cellulose, starch; glucose monomers)
* polypeptides (amino acid monomers)
* HONCP: 1,2,3,4,5 bonds in Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Carbon, and Phosphorus, respectively
* amino acid components: amino group (-NH2), carboxyl group (-COOH), central carbon, side group
* levels of protein structure: primary (sequence), secondary (helices, sheets), tertiary (disulfide bridges between cysteins), quaternary (number of polypeptide subunits)
* biological membranes: lipid bilayer, phospholipids, hydrophylic head, hydrophobic tail
* membrane proteins: peripheral, integral
* enzyme: proteins that catalyze chemical reactions, activation energy, names end in "-ase"
* ATP from ADP plus P plus energy, A in ATP is adenosine (one of the monomers making up DNA and RNA)
* NADPH from NADP+ plus H+ plus 2 e-, reduction (charge reduced) vs. oxidation (the reverse reaction)
* visble light, 400-700nm, wavelength, light energy: higher for shorter wavelengths, ultraviolet, infrared
* light-absorbing pigments in leaves: chlorophyll-a, chlorophyll-b, carotenoids (many kinds)
* choroplasts: stroma, thylakoids, thylakoid membrane separates stroma from space inside thylakoid, granum = stack of thylakoids
* light-dependent vs. light-independent reactions
* light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis: light and water in, oxygen, ATP, and NADPH out
* light-independent reactions of photosynthesis: ATP, NADPH, CO2 in, sugar out
* photosystems (PSI and PSII), NADP+ reductase enzyme, cytochrome

## Make and label drawings

Making drawings (on scrap paper, iPad, etc.) and labeling them without looking at your notes is an excellent way to tell how much you know and what you need to work on. Here are some possible drawings you could make. For each, how many of the terms above can you use to label your drawing?

* plant body with root, stem, leaves, buds
* a cell showing primary and secondary cell wall, pits, plasmodesmata, organelles, etc.
* a leaf in cross section showing epidermis, mesophyll layers, vascular bundle (with xylem and phloem in correct orientation), stomata
* monocot vs. eudicot stem in cross section (label pith, cortex, cambium, bundles, epidermis, etc.)
* draw a diagram of a biological membrane in cross section showing phospholipids and an integral membrane protein. What parts are water molecules clinging to?
* draw a thylakoid membrane with PSII, cytochrome, PSI, NADP+ reductase, and ATP synthase. Explain to yourself or a study partner how the light-dependent reactions work, where electron pairs originate, where they end up, and how ATP and NADPH are produced.

## Look around you!

* Can you find leaves on trees around campus that show different leaf arrangements, venation patterns, complexities? Can you find the lateral buds?
* Look for natural wood doors and floors and try to tell what type of section you are looking at (radial vs. tangential). Can you find rays, vessels?
* Can you find lenticels on trees around campus. These may only be visible on younger twigs. Can you see leaf scars and terminal bud scars on older parts of twigs?
* Without falling in, visit Swan Lake (front of Chemistry building) or Mirror Lake (lake with island along Route 195) and look for oxygen bubbles in algae
