## Second lecture exam (Friday, Oct. 25, 2024)

Note: 

* this study guide is subject to updates until this notice is removed.
* some topics listed here have not yet been covered in lecture

### Phylogeny

You should be able to draw the phylogeny given in class from memory, including these taxa:

* Cyanobacteria
* Brown algae
* Diatoms
* Animals
* Fungi
* Red algae
* Chlorophyte green algae
* Streptophyte green algae
* Mosses
* Hornworts
* Liverworts
* Lycophytes
* Pteridophytes
* Gymnosperms
* Angiosperms

You should be able to identify these major groups on the phylogeny and say whether each is a monophyletic group:

* Algae
* Prokaryotes
* Eukaryotes
* Opisthokonts
* Heterokonts
* Embryophytes
* Bryophytes
* Nonvascular plants
* Vascular plants
* Seedless vascular plants
* Seed plants
* Flowering plants

You should also be able able to place the origin of these major events at the appropriate place on the phylogeny:

* Primary endosymbiosis event leading to all chloroplasts
* Secondary endosymbiosis event leading to heterokont chloroplasts
* Starch used as food storage
* Chlorophyll a
* Chlorophyll b
* Chlorophyll c
* Carotenoid pigments
* nucleus with linear chromosomes
* Loss of phycobilin pigments (phycocyanin, phycoerythrin)
* Embryos in green plants
* Twisted sperm
* Cellulose cell walls
* Fucoxanthin pigments
* Vascular tissues (xylem, phloem)
* Sporophyte dominance in the life cycle
* Branched sporophytes
* Megaphylls
* Microphylls
* Seeds
* Pollen
* Vessels in xylem
* Double fertilization
* Carpels
* Spores via meiosis
* Heterocytes

### Life Cycles

You should be able to provide examples (of particular genera whose life cycles were covered in lecture, or larger groups) that have these traits:

* Zygote is only diploid stage
* Gametes are only haploid stage
* Heterospory
* Homospory
* Oogamy
* Isogamy

You should be able to define these terms (note that some of these are special cases of others):

* Anteridium
* Oogonium
* Archegonium
* Gametangium
* Sporangium
* Gametophyte
* Sporophyte
* Spore
* Zygote
* Gamete
* Egg
* Sperm
* Megaspore
* Microspore

You should be able to draw a homosporous life cycle from memory, connecting the following terms with arrows pointed in the correct direction:

* Meiosis
* Syngamy
* Zygote
* Sperm
* Egg
* Gametophyte
* Sporophyte
* Spores

You should be able to draw a heterosporous life cycle from memory, connecting the following terms with arrows pointed in the correct direction:

* Meiosis
* Syngamy
* Zygote
* Sperm
* Egg
* Megaametophyte
* Microametophyte
* Sporophyte
* Megaspores
* Micropores

You should, for both homosporous and heterosporous life cycles above, add these terms in the appropriate places:

* Mitosis
* Haploid
* Diploid

You should be able to define these terms and list the group(s) in which these features are found:

* Gemmae 
* Calyptra
* Peristome
* Archegoniophore
* Antheridiophore
* Elaters
* Thallus

### Mitosis and Meiosis

You should be able to...
* draw a cell cycle diagram showing G0, G1, S, G2, and the 4 phases of mitosis in order
* list what key events take place in each phase of mitosis
* identify whether a cell is in anophase I or anophase II of meiosis by the number of chromatids in each chromosome
* explain the key differences between prophase I of meiosis and prophase of mitosis
* describe the two mechanisms by which the genetic contributions of parents get mixed up in creating the haploid genome of a gamete
* answer these questions: "How many cells are created from a cell that undergoes mitosis? meiosis?"
* answer these questions: "Can mitosis happen in a haploid cells? Can meiosis happen in a haploid cell?"
* explain how chromosomes get from the center of the cell to the poles in anaphase of mitosis or meiosis (do they walk or are they pulled?)
