### Syllabus for Fall Semester 2022
_Last updated August 19, 2022_

[Scroll straight to today in the schedule](#today)

### Description of the course 

This is a freshman-level introdution to the science of plants, emphasizing the anatomy, physiology, diversity, genetics, and evolution of green plants (ncluding green algae). Because it is a general education course, there is considerable attention given to how science works, from hypothesis generation to design of experiments to test the predictions arising from hypotheses. As is traditional in introductory botany courses, some time is devoted to fungi, cyanobacteria, red algae, brown algae and diatoms, and slime molds, even though these organisms are now known to be distantly related to green plants.

### Learning goals

BIOL 1110 is a General Education CA3-lab course. Along with other CA3 courses, it has these learning objectives (paraphrased from the [GEOC Assessment and Learning Outcomes web page](https://geoc.uconn.edu/ca3-assessment-and-learning-outcomes/)):

* know basic concepts and vocabulary of an area of science and the importance of this to society
* familiarity with current scientific methods and how they are applied to gain knowledge
* understand the scientific method
* understand the difference between science and pseudoscience
* be able to describe a scientific experiment and explain how it applies the scientific method
* be familiar with some unresolved scientific questions
* be able to analyze debates about the role science plays in shaping human society
* acquire skills associated with scientific inquiry

BIOL 1110 is also a **majors** course. It can be substituted for the core course BIOL 1108 in, for example, the EEB major. Thus, if you are not a science major, please do not expect this course to be taught at a non-majors level.

### Attendance in lab and lecture

Attending all lectures and labs is important because this is the only way to obtain the material on which you will be tested. 

### Exams

There are two midterm lecture exams and one final exam in this course.

### Textbook and lab manual

* Plant Biology (3rd edition) by Linda Graham, James M. Graham, and Lee W. Wilcox. (The textbook is available only as a PDF and is not available in the UConn Bookstore; purchase it directly from [LJLM Press](https://www.ljlmpress.com/plant_biology.html))
* Introduction to Botany, Biology 1110 Laboratory Manual, University of Connecticut, 2022 (Chapters of the lab manual will be made available to you for free as needed as PDF files)

The purpose of the assigned textbook reading is to give you the material from a different perspective. This is important because sometimes one person's explanation of a subject does not work for all people. You are not expected to know everything in the chapters assigned. Concentrate your textbook reading on subjects that were discussed in lecture. If you know I discussed a topic, but you cannot understand the topic even after reading about it in the textbook, please come to see one of us during office hours or arrange some other time to meet with us. Some test questions will come from the textbook, so the assigned reading is important.

### Grade determination

_Note: this section may change before the semester begins_

The total number of points you can earn is 500. The lecture component accounts for 300 points and the lab accounts for the remaining 200.

Lecture        | Points
:------------- | :---------------
Exam 1         | 100
Exam 2         | 100
Final exam     | 100
 
Laboratory     | Points
:------------- | :---------------
Quizes         | 80
Transpiration  | 10
Photosynthesis | 10
Selection      | 30
Hormones       | 30
Climate change | 10
Lab practical  | 30

### Grading scale

If you earn at least the percentage of total points indicated in the table below, you will be given the corresponding letter grade. If you earn fewer than 60% of the total points, you will receive an F for the course:

Percentage | Letter grade
:--------: | :----------:
92% | A
90% | A-
88% | B+
82% | B
80% | B-
78% | C+
72% | C
70% | C-
68% | D+
62% | D
60% | D-

Note that you can find out where you stand at any point in the course using the [Grade Center in HuskyCT](https://huskyct.uconn.edu). **No adjustments will be made to your grade at the end of the semester**, and **no extra credit work** will be allowed. It is thus very important to do as well as you can on every test and every assignment.

#### Final exam information

You can obtain the date and time of the final exam by following the directions on the [Registrar’s web site](https://registrar.uconn.edu/final-exam-schedule/).
You are required to be available for your exam and/or complete an assessment during the time stated in the Registrar's Office Schedule. If you have a conflict with this time you must visit the Office of Student Services and Advocacy to discuss the possibility of rescheduling this assessment.
