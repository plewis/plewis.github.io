Zach will try to create ~10 questions for each lecture. These questions are optional, and are tools you can use to gauge your understanding of the material from lecture and help guide your studying. 

## Lecture 3 - 25 Jan 2022

### Concensus Trees
*	What are the differences between strict, semi-strict, and majority rule consensus trees? 
* What is a rogue taxon, and what do rogue taxa have to do with maximum agreement subtrees?

### Parsimony
*	Who was Willi Hennig? How does his phylogenetic method differ from parsimony, and what is the main issue it cannot overcome?
*	Who were Charles Michener and Robert Sokal and what was their contribution to the field of phylogenetics? They had a different name to their work though, what is it?
*	Who were Anthony Edwards and Luca Cavalli-Sforza? What was their contribution to Phylogenetics? Why didn’t their likelihood analysis work?
* Who were Joseph Camin and Robert Sokal, and how does their method differ from true parsimony. 
*	What type of data did the first molecular tree rely on, and why wasn’t it DNA? (Hint: Think about Fred Sanger)
*	In what circumstances might you use ordered characters and when might you use unordered characters? 
*	What is a constant site and how does it differ from an variable site? What does this have to do with parsimony?
*	Make sure you can explain how parsimony works with a small tree. What do steps have to do with parsimony, and what is the principle of parsimony?
* What do transitions and transversions have to do with a nucleotide substitution matrix? (this is something we'll learn more about next week)
