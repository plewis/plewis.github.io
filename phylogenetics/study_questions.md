Zach will try to create ~10 questions for each lecture. These questions are optional, and are tools you can use to gauge your understanding of the material from lecture and help guide your studying. 

## Lecture 3 - 25 Jan 2022

### Consensus Trees
*	What are the differences between strict, semi-strict, and majority rule consensus trees? 
* What is a rogue taxon, and what do rogue taxa have to do with maximum agreement subtrees?

### Parsimony
*	Who was Willi Hennig? How does his phylogenetic method differ from parsimony, and what is the main issue it cannot overcome?
*	Who were Charles Michener and Robert Sokal and what was their contribution to the field of phylogenetics? They had a different name to their work though, what is it?
*	Who were Anthony Edwards and Luca Cavalli-Sforza? What was their contribution to Phylogenetics? Why didn’t their likelihood analysis work?
* Who were Joseph Camin and Robert Sokal, and how does their method differ from true parsimony. 
*	What type of data did the first molecular tree rely on, and why wasn’t it DNA? (Hint: Think about Fred Sanger)
*	In what circumstances might you use ordered characters and when might you use unordered characters? 
*	What is a constant site and how does it differ from an variable site? What does this have to do with parsimony?
*	Make sure you can explain how parsimony works with a small tree. What do steps have to do with parsimony, and what is the principle of parsimony?
* What do transitions and transversions have to do with a nucleotide substitution matrix? (this is something we'll learn more about next week) 

## Lecture 4 - 27 Jan 2022

### Review
* Make sure you can make phylogentic trees from splits (Re: Homework 1)

### Parsimony Continued
*	What would a step matrix look like if we don’t count transitions, but we weight transversions from purines to pyrimidines 2 times more than transversions from pyrimidines to purines. 
*	What are the differences between synapomorphic, autapomorphic, and symplesiomorphic character states? Draw a simple tree and indicate in which taxa the above characters states would be present. 
*	Can you think of another word from evolution which describes homoplasy?
* What are the consistency and retention indexes? How are they used in the context of parsimony trees? 

### Distance Methods (Least Squares and Minimum Evolution)
* If you perform a distance analysis (LS/ME), will your restults (tree length) be specific to a given tree topology, a given character, or both?
* How does SplitsTree differ from a normal phylogenetic tree? What can this tell you about the tree?

## Lecture 5 - 01 Feb 2022

### Review (from lab)
* What is a star tree, and what does it have to do with a neighbor joining tree? 

### Exploring Models
* Why do we use models? Be able to complain model complexity and model fit. 

### Jukes-Cantor 1969
* How many parameters does this model have? What are the model parameter(s) and what are the assumptions we invoke when we use this model? Can you make a substitution matrix for this model?
* What do branch lengths (edge lengeths) represent? What parameters do we use to calculate the them – why is it impossible to calculate these parameters *de novo*?
* Say we are calculating a transition probability for a nucleotide subsitution on a site from a G to a T. Before this site had a G nucleotide, the nucleotide was an A. How does this change how we go about calculating transition probabilities when using a Markov model?
