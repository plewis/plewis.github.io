Zach will try to create ~10 questions for each lecture. These questions are optional, and are tools you can use to gauge your understanding of the material from lecture and help guide your studying. 

## Lecture 3 - 25 Jan 2022
1.	What are the differences between strict, semi-strict, and majority rule consensus trees? 
2.	 What is a rogue taxon, and what do rogue taxa have to do with maximum agreement subtrees?
### Parsimony
1.	Who was Willi Hennig? How does his phylogenetic method differ from parsimony, and what is the main issue it cannot overcome?
2.	Who were Charles Michener and Robert Sokal and what was their contribution to the field of phylogenetics? They had a different name to their work though, what is it?
3.	Who were Anthony Edwards and Luca Cavalli-Sforza? What was their contribution to Phylogenetics? Why didn’t their likelihood analysis work?
4.	Who were Joseph Camin and Robert Sokal, and how does their method differ from true parsimony. 
5.	What type of data did the first molecular tree rely on, and why wasn’t it DNA? (Hint: Think about Fred Sanger)
6.	In what circumstances might you use ordered characters and when might you use unordered characters? 
7.	What is a constant site and how does it differ from an variable site? What does this have to do with parsimony?
8.	Make sure you can explain how parsimony works with a small tree. What do steps have to do with parsimony, and what is the principle of parsimony?
10.	What do transitions and transversions have to do with a nucleotide substitution matrix? (this is something we'll learn more about next week)
