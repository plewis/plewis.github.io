## Goals

In this lab you will learn how to use the program [BayesTraits](http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/BayesTraitsV4.0.0.html), written by Andrew Meade and Mark Pagel. BayesTraits can perform several analyses related to evaluating evolutionary correlation and ancestral state reconstruction in discrete morphological traits. 

## Getting started

Login to your account on the Health Center (Xanadu) cluster, then issue

    srun --qos=mcbstudent --partition=mcbstudent --mem=1G --pty bash
    
to start a session on a node that is not currently running jobs. 
    
### Download BayesTraits

There is no module for BayesTraits, so we will have to download the latest version into your home directory:

    cd
    curl -O http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/Files/BayesTraitsV4.0.0-Linux.tar.gz

Now unpack the gzipped "tape archive" (tar) file as follows:

    tar zxvf BayesTraitsV4.0.0-Linux.tar.gz

This will create a directory named _BayesTraitsV4.0.0-Linux_ in your home directory. Move the BayesTraits executable from inside _BayesTraitsV4.0.0-Linux_ down one level to your home directory for easier access:

    cd BayesTraitsV4.0.0-Linux
    mv BayesTraitsV4 ..

Go back to Mark Pagel's web site and [download the manual](http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/Files/BayesTraitsV4.0.0-Manual.pdf) for BayesTraits. This is a PDF file and should open in your browser window.

#### A little aside on tar files

Data used to be stored on magnetic tape, not hard drives, and the tar (tape archive) program is what was used to move files to and from the tape. This tells you something about how old the tar format is because perhaps none of you have even seen a magnetic tape used for data storage! The tar command takes all the files in a directory and simply concatenates them into one gigantic file. It also preserves file permissions and the directory structure. The four letters after the command name tar are zxvf. These stand for the following:
* z = uncompress (the gz at the end of the file tells you it is a compressed archive, so the z tells tar to uncompress it before unpacking it)
* x = extract (unpack the archive into individual files. You would use c here if you were creating a tar file)
* v = verbose (tell us what's going on as you unpack)
* f = file (this tells tar that the file name is coming next, so don't put f earlier in the list)

This tar file has been compressed using the program gzip, which adds the gz ending to the file name. Most tar files are compressed with gzip or some similar algorithm so that the file requires less time to move across the internet.

### Create a directory

Use the unix <tt>mkdir</tt> command to create a directory to play in today:

    mkdir ~/btlab
    cd ~/btlab

### Download the tree and data files 

For this exercise, you will use data and trees used in the SIMMAP analyses presented in this paper:

<blockquote>Jones C.S., Bakker F.T., Schlichting C.D., Nicotra A.B. 2009. Leaf shape evolution in the South African genus _Pelargonium_ L'Her. (Geraniaceae). Evolution. 63:479â€“497.</blockquote>

The data and trees were not made available in the online supplementary materials for this paper, but I have obtained permission to use them for this laboratory exercise.

[pelly.txt](/assets/data/pelly.txt) This is the data file. It contains data for two traits (leaf dissection and leaf venation) for 154 taxa in the plant genus _Pelargonium_.

[pelly.tre](/assets/data/pelly.tre) This is the tree file. It contains 99 trees sampled from an MCMC analysis of DNA sequences.

Here's how to curl these files into your _btlab_ folder

    cd
    curl -O https://plewis.github.io/assets/data/pelly.txt
    curl -O https://plewis.github.io/assets/data/pelly.tre
    
## Assessing the strength of association between two binary characters

The first thing we will do is see if the two characters (leaf dissection and leaf venation) in _pelly.txt_ are evolutionarily correlated. 

### Trait 1: Leaf dissection

{% include figure.html description="From Fig. 1E and 1F of the paper" url="/assets/img/dissection.png" css="image-right noborder" width="400px" %}
The **leaf dissection** trait comprises two states (I've merged some states in the original data matrix to produce just 2 states): 

* 0 means leaves are _entire_ (_unlobed_ or _shallowly lobed_ in the original study), and 
* 1 means leaves are _dissected_ (_lobed_, _deeply lobed_, or _dissected_ in the original study).

### Trait 2: Leaf venation 

{% include figure.html description="From www.ibiblio.org/botnet/test/6-16-3.html" url="/assets/img/venation.png" css="image-right noborder" width="300px" %}
The **leaf venation** trait comprises two states: 

* 0 means leaves are _pinnately veined_ (one main vein runs down the long axis of the leaf blade), and 
* 1 means leaves are _palmately veined_ (several major veins meet at the base of the leaf). 

We will first use maximum likelihood to estimate the rates at which these two traits evolve under both an independent model (traits assumed to evolve independently) and a dependent model (the rates of change in one trait may differ depending on the state present in the other trait).

To test whether these two traits are correlated, we will carry out Bayesian MCMC analyses and estimate the **marginal likelihood** under two models. The model (independent or dependent) with the higher marginal likelihood will be the preferred model. You will recall that we discussed both of these models in lecture, and also discussed the **stepping-stone method** that BayesTraits uses to evaluate models. You may wish to pull up those lectures to help answer the questions that you will encounter momentarily, as well as the BayesTraits manual.

Then we will use reversible-jump MCMC to determine which of several thousand models is best. This method effectively uses marginal likelihoods to choose among models, but has the advantage that you need not specify which models you are interested in comparing beforehand.

Finally, I'll show you how to estimate the m of different ancestral state combinations using BayesTraits.

## Maximum Likelihood: Independence model 

Type the following to start the BayesTraits program (assuming you are in the _btlab_ folder):

    ../BayesTraitsV4 pelly.tre pelly.txt

You should see this selection appear:

    Please select the model of evolution to use.
    1)	    MultiState
    2)	    Discrete: Independent
    3)	    Discrete: Dependant
    4)	    Continuous: Random Walk (Model A)
    5)	    Continuous: Directional (Model B)
    6)	    Continuous: Regression
    7)	    Independent Contrast 
    8)	    Independent Contrast: Correlation 
    9)	    Independent Contrast: Regression
    10)    Discrete: Covarion
    12)    Fat Tail
    13)    Geo
 
Press the 2 key and hit enter to select the Independent model. Now you should see these choices appear:

    Please Select the analysis method to use.
    1)	Maximum Likelihood.
    2)	MCMC
 
Press the 1 key and hit enter to select maximum likelihood. Now you should see some output showing the choices you explicitly (or implicitly) made:

         States:                     4

Now type <tt>run</tt> and hit enter to perform the analysis, which will consist of estimating the parameters of the independent model on each of the 99 trees contained in the _pelly.tre_ file. You will notice that BayesTraits created a new file: _pelly.txt.Log.txt_. 

**Rename this file** _ml-independent.txt_ so that it will not be overwritten the next time you run BayesTraits:

    mv pelly.txt.Log.txt ml-independent.txt

Open the _ml-independent.txt_ file in nano (or bring it back to your laptop and use BBEdit (Mac) or Notepad++ (Windows) to view it). Scrolling past the first 33 lines, you should see the start of the parameter samples:

    Tree No	Lh	alpha1	beta1	alpha2	beta2	Root - P(0,0)	Root - P(0,1)	Root - P(1,0)	Root - P(1,1)

**Before typing run** type the following command, which tells BayesTraits to change all priors from the default Uniform(0,100) to an Exponential distribution with mean 29:

    pa exp 29

> :thinking: Why am I suggesting this switch? (Hint: what is the support of a Uniform(0,100) distribution vs. an Exponential(1/29) distribution?)

{% comment %}
The support of an Exponential(1/29) distribution matches the domain of the parameter (i.e. 0.0 to infinity).
{% endcomment %}

> :thinking: Why choose 29? (Hint: the variance of a Uniform(0,100) distribution equals 100^2/12 and the variance of an Exponential(1/29) distribution equals 29^2)

{% comment %}
The variance of an Exponential(1/29) distribution is 29^2 = 841, which is similar to the variance of the Uniform(0,100) distribution, which is (100-0)^2/12 = 833.33.
{% endcomment %}

Also type the following to ask BayesTraits to perform a stepping-stone analysis:

    stones 100 10000
 
Now run the analysis. This will estimate 100 ratios to brook the gap between posterior and prior, using a sample size of 10000 for each "stone".

Here is an example of the output stored in the file _pelly.txt.Log.txt_ after you type <tt>run</tt> to start the analysis:

**Before doing anything else,  rename the file** _pelly.txt.Log.txt_ to _mcmc-dependent.txt_, and _pelly.txt.Stones.txt_ to _mcmc-dependent.Stones.txt_ so that they will not be overwritten the next time you run BayesTraits.

    mv pelly.txt.Log.txt mcmc-dependent.txt
    mv pelly.txt.Stones.txt mcmc-dependent.Stones.txt 

The _Tree No_ column shows which of the 99 trees in the supplied _pelly.tre_ treefile was chosen at random to be used for that particular sample point. BayesTraits is sampling trees from the posterior distribution here; it cannot _actually_ sample trees from the posterior because we have given it only data for two morphological characters, which would not provide nearly enough information to estimate the phylogeny for 154 taxa. It is as if we had given BayesTraits sequence data as well as our 2 morphological characters and it was using only the sequence data to estimate the posterior distribution of trees and edge lengths and only the morphological data to estimate rates for the morphological characters.

## Bayesian Reversible-jump MCMC

Run BayesTraits again, specifying Dependent model, MCMC and, this time, specify the reversible-jump approach using the command

    rj exp 29
 
The previous command also sets the prior. Type <tt>run</tt> to start, then when it finishes rename the output file _rjmcmc-dependent.txt_:

    mv pelly.txt.Log.txt rjmcmc-dependent.txt

The reversible-jump approach carries out an MCMC analysis in which the number of model parameters (the dimension of the model) potentially changes from one iteration to the next. The full model allows each of the 8 rate parameters to be estimated separately, while other models restrict the values of some rate parameters to equal the values of other rate parameters. The output contains a column titled **Model string** that summarizes the model in a string of 8 symbols corresponding to the 8 rate parameters q12, q13, q21, q24, q31, q34, q42, and q43. For example, the model string "'1 0 Z 0 1 1 0 2" sets q21 to zero (Z),  q13=q24=q42 (parameter group 0), q12=q31=q34 (parameter group 1), and q43 has its own non-zero value distinct from parameter groups 0 and 1. 

You could copy the "spreadsheet" part of the output file into Excel and sort by the model string column, but let's instead use Python to summarize the output file. Download (e.g. using curl) the file _btsummary.py_ and run it as follows:

    curl -O http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/people/plewis/courses/phylogenetics/data/btsummary.py
    module load python/3.8.1
    python3 btsummary.py
    
This should produce counts of model strings. (If it doesn't, check to make sure your output file is named _rjmcmc-dependent.txt</tt> because _btsummary.py_ tries to open a file by that name.)   Answer the following questions using the counts provided by _btsummary.py_:

> :thinking: Which model string is most common?_ 

{% comment %}
I got 0 0 Z 0 0 0 0 0 with count 968
{% endcomment %}

> :thinking: What does this model imply?

{% comment %}
All rates are the same except q21, which is forced to have rate zero. q21 equals 0 implies that entire,palmate leaves never change to entire,pinnate
{% endcomment %}

Notice that many (but not all) model strings have Z for q21. One way to estimate the marginal posterior probability of the hypothesis that q21=0 is to sum the counts for all model strings that have Z in that third position corresponding to q21. While it is pretty easy to add these numbers in your head, let's modify _btsummary.py_ to do this for us (this might come in useful if you ever encounter results that are more complex): open _btsummary.py_ and locate the line containing the [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) search that pulls out all the model strings from the BayesTrait output file:

    model_list = re.findall("'[Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9]", stuff, re.M | re.S)
 
The <tt>re.findall</tt> function performs a regular expression search of the text stored in the variable stuff looking for strings that have a series of 8 space-separated characters, each of which is _either_ the character Z _or_ a digit between 0 and 9 (inclusive). Copy this line (in nano, you can do this with Ctrl-K (cut), Ctrl-U (uncut), Ctrl-U (uncut)), then comment out one copy by starting the line with the hash (#) character:

    #model_list = re.findall("'[Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9]", stuff, re.M | re.S)
    model_list = re.findall("'[Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9]", stuff, re.M | re.S)
    
Now modify the uncommented copy such that it counts only models with Z in the third position of the model string.

    model_list = re.findall("'[Z0-9] [Z0-9] Z [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9] [Z0-9]", stuff, re.M | re.S)
 
Rerun _btsummary.py_, and now the total matches should equal the number of model strings sampled in which q21=0.

> :thinking: So what is the estimated marginal posterior probability that q21=0?

{% comment %}
I got 0.984
{% endcomment %}

> :thinking: Why is the term marginal appropriate here (as in marginal posterior probability)?

{% comment %}
We are estimating the sum of all joint posteriors in which q21 equals 0 (we are marginalizing over models)

## Estimating ancestral states

{% include figure.html description="Xerophyte venation" url="/assets/img/Xerophytevenation.png" css="image-right noborder" width="400px" %}

The Jones et al. 2009 study estimated ancestral states using SIMMAP. In particular, they found that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the xerophytic (dry-adapted) clade of pelargoniums almost certainly had pinnate venation (see red circle in figure on right). Let's see what BayesTraits says.

Start BayesTraits in the usual way, specifying 1 (Multistate) on the first screen and 2 (MCMC) on the second. After the options are output, type the following commands in, one line at a time, finishing with the run command:

    pa exp 29
    addtag xerotag alternans104 rapaceum130
    addmrca xero xerotag
    run
    
The **addmrca** command tells BayesTraits to add columns of numbers to the output that display the probabilities of each state for each character in the most recent common ancestor of the taxa listed in the **addtag** command (2 taxa are sufficient to define the MRCA, but more taxa may be included). The column headers for the last four columns of output should be (I've added the comments starting with <tt><--</tt>)

    xero - S(0) - P(0) <-- character 0 (dissection), probability of state 0 (unlobed)
    xero - S(0) - P(1) <-- character 0 (dissection), probability of state 1 (dissected)
    xero - S(1) - P(0) <-- character 1 (venation), probability of state 0 (pinnate)
    xero - S(1) - P(1) <-- character 1 (venation), probability of state 1 (palmate)

You can download the output file and view it in Tracer. That way you can use Tracer to tell you the means of the four columns above. Note that you will need to remove the initial text from the file (but keep the column headers) before Tracer will recognize it.

> :thinking: Which state is most common at the xerophyte MRCA node for leaf venation?

{% comment %}
Pinnate venation; xero - S(1) - P(0) has mean 0.9323
{% endcomment %}

> :thinking: Which state is most common at the xerophyte MRCA node for leaf dissection?

{% comment %}
Dissected; xero - S(0) - P(1) has mean 0.9382
{% endcomment %}

That concludes the introduction to BayesTraits. A glance through the manual will convince you that there is much more to this program than we have time to cover in a single lab period, but you should know enough now to explore the rest on your own if you need these features.

{% comment %}
## Challenge 

BayesTraits allows you to _fossilize_ (or _fossilise_ in British English) traits for specific nodes. The relevant section of the BayesTraits manual is titled _Fixing node values / fossilising_ and, for this challenge, you will need to locate the table at the end of this section (just before the section titled _Discrete_ begins).

Estimate the marginal likelihood under these 2 models, both using the dependence model and MCMC:

* fossilize the MRCA of the xerophytic (dry-adapted) clade to have pinnate venation
* fossilize the MRCA of the xerophytic (dry-adapted) clade to have palmate venation

Note: the  <tt>Node01</tt> in the manual is just a name you invent to identify this fossilization constraint; you could call this <tt>xeronode</tt> if you want.

The main question is: What is the log Bayes Factor for pinnate vs. palmate venation?

Turn in the following:
* The log marginal likelihoods for the two models
* The commands you used to achieve these log marginal likelihoods in BayesTraits
* The log Bayes Factor you calculated
* Assuming the two models compared have equal prior probabilities, how many times more probable is pinnate than palmate leaves in the ancestor of the xerophyte clade?

Hint: for the last item, use $$e^{\mbox{log-BF}}$$ to convert your log Bayes Factor to a ratio of marginal likelihoods, then multiply by the ratio of model prior probabilities. This uses Bayes Rule to convert the likelihood of the model to the posterior probability of the model.
