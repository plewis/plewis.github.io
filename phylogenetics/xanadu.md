title: Using the UConn Xanadu cluster 
permalink: /xanadu/
---
The UConn [Computational Biology Core](http://bioinformatics.uconn.edu) is part of the [Center for Genome Innovation (CGI)](http://cgi.uconn.edu/). We will use the Xanadu computing cluster located at the UConn Health Center for most of the data crunching we will do in this course. By now, you should have an account on the cluster, and today you will learn how to start analyses remotely (i.e. from your laptop), check on their status, and download the results when your analysis is finished.

##  Obtaining the necessary communications software 
You will be using a couple of simple (and free) programs to communicate with the head node of the cluster. 

###  If you use Windows...please scroll down to the Windows section
###  If you use MacOS 10.x... 
####  SSH 
The program **ssh** will allow you to communicate with the cluster using a protocol known as SSH (Secure Shell). You will use ssh to send commands to the cluster and see the output generated. 

Start by opening the Terminal application, which you can find in the Applications/Utilities folder on your hard drive. Using the Terminal program, you can connect to the cluster with the following command:

    ssh username@xanadu-submit-ext.cam.uchc.edu
 
where username should be replaced by your username on the cluster.

You may wish to install [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/), which is a terminal program that makes some things easier than Terminal, but the built-in Terminal will work just fine.

**Creating a shortcut**

If you want to avoid having to type the long command above every time you want to connect to the cluster, it is possible to create a shortcut. You will need to edit the _config_ file in your _.ssh_ directory. Directories with names beginning with a period are not usually shown, but you can open this directory in Finder by typing 

    cd
    open .ssh

in your terminal (the initial cd command changes the directory to your default, a.k.a. home, directory).

If you do not see a file named "config" in your ".ssh" directory, create an empty config file using the command 

    touch config

Open the config file in a text editor such as [https://www.barebones.com BBEdit] (NOT a word processor such as Microsoft Word or Pages!) and add the following lines, replacing _eeb5349usr10_ with your actual username on xanadu:

    host xanadu
        HostName xanadu-submit-ext.cam.uchc.edu
        User eeb5349usr10
    host xfer
        HostName transfer.cam.uchc.edu
        User eeb5349usr10

Once you save the config file, you should be able to just type

    ssh xanadu

to login to the xanadu cluster. The second entry (xfer) will be used when transferring files to and from the cluster.

####  SCP/SFTP 
An SCP or SFTP client is needed to to transfer files back and forth using the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) or Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). I will show you how to transfer files using both methods, but for now  you should go ahead and install [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/download/). Cyberduck provides a nice graphical user interface, but you might find that the command line clients let you get your work done faster once you get used to using them.

Please skip now to the section [Learning enough UNIX to get around](#learning-enough-unix-to-get-around)

###  If you use Windows... 
####  SSH 
The program **Git for Windows** provides a terminal that will allow you to communicate with the cluster using a protocol known as SSH (Secure Shell). We will not actually use the "git" part of "Git for Windows", although it is there in case you need it later. Instead, you will use the Git for Windows bash shell to send commands to the cluster and see the output generated.

Visit the [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org) web site, press the Download button, and install Git for Windows on your system. Once installed, open Git BASH from the All Programs section of the start menu. This will open a terminal running the bash shell (a shell is a program that interprets operating system control commands) on your desktop.

Connect to the cluster with the following command:

    ssh username@xanadu-submit-ext.cam.uchc.edu
    
where _username_ should be replaced by your username on the cluster.

**Creating a shortcut**

If you want to avoid having to type the long command above every time you want to connect to the cluster, it is possible to create a shortcut. You will need to edit the _config_ file in your _.ssh_ directory. Open (or create, if it does not yet exist) the file named _config_ in a text editor such as [https://notepad-plus-plus.org NotePad++] (NOT a word processor such as Microsoft Word!) and add the following lines (replace _plewis_ with your actual username on xanadu, and replace _/c/Users/Paul Lewis_ with your home directory path):

    host xanadu
        HostName xanadu-submit-ext.cam.uchc.edu
        User plewis
        IdentityFile "/c/Users/Paul Lewis/.ssh/id_rsa"
        Cipher blowfish
    host xfer
        HostName transfer.cam.uchc.edu
        User plewis
        IdentityFile "/c/Users/Paul Lewis/.ssh/id_rsa"
        Cipher blowfish

Use the `pwd` command to find out what your home directory path is, and use double quotes if your home directory path contains embedded spaces (note that I had to use quotes for mine).

Once you save the config file, you should be able to just type

    ssh xanadu

to login to the xanadu cluster. (The second entry (xfer) will be used for transferring files to and from Xanadu.)

####  SCP/SFTP 

An SCP or SFTP client is needed to to transfer files back and forth using the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) or Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). For now  you should go ahead and install [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/download/). Cyberduck provides a nice graphical user interface, which makes moving files back and forth easy.

###  Learning enough UNIX to get around 

I'm presuming that you do not know a lot of UNIX commands, but, even if you are already a UNIX guru, please complete this section anyway because otherwise you will fail to create some files you will need later.

####  ls command: finding out what is in the present working directory 

The **ls** command lists the files in the _present working directory_. Try typing just

    ls

If you need more details about files than you see here, type

    ls -la

instead. This version provides information about file permissions, ownership, size, and last modification date.

####  pwd command: finding out what directory you are in 

Typing 

    pwd

shows you the full path of the present working directory. The path shown should end with your username, indicating that you are currently in your home directory. If you are using one of the students accounts, e.g. `eeb5349usr10`, then the directory path will end with `eeb5349/usr10`, not `eeb5349usr10`.

####  mkdir command: creating a new directory 

Typing the following command will create a new directory named _pauprun_ in your home directory:

    mkdir pauprun

Use the `ls` command now to make sure a directory of that name was indeed created.

####  cd command: leaving the nest and returning home again 

The cd command lets you change the present working directory. To move into the newly-created _pauprun_ directory, type

    cd pauprun

You can always go back to your home directory (no matter how lost you get!) by typing just cd by itself

    cd

If you want to go down one directory level (say from _pauprun_ back down to your home directory), you can specify the parent directory using two dots:

    cd ..

####  Creating run.nex using the nano editor 

One way to create a new file, or edit one that already exists, is to use the nano editor. You will now use nano to create a run.nex file containing a paup block. You will later execute this file in PAUP* to perform an analysis.

First use the pwd command to see where you are, then use cd to go into the _pauprun_ directory if you are not already there. Type

    nano run.nex

This will open the nano editor, and it should say `[ New File ]` at the bottom of the window to indicate that the run.nex file does not already exist. Note the menu of the commands along the bottom two rows. Each of these commands is invoked using the Ctrl key with the letter indicated. Thus, `^X` Exit indicates that you can use the Ctrl key in combination with the letter X to exit nano.

For now, type the following into the editor:

    #nexus

    begin paup;
        log file=algae.output.txt start replace flush;
        execute algae.nex;
        set criterion=likelihood autoclose;
        lset nst=2 basefreq=estimate tratio=estimate rates=gamma shape=estimate;
        hsearch swap=none start=stepwise addseq=random nrep=1;
        lscores 1;
        lset basefreq=previous tratio=previous shape=previous;
        hsearch swap=tbr start=1;
        savetrees file=algae.ml.tre brlens;
        log stop;
        quit;
    end;

Once you have entered everything, use `^X` to exit. Nano will ask if you want to save the modified **buffer** (a _buffer_ is a predefined amount of computer memory used to store the text you type; the text stored in the buffer will be lost once you exit the program unless you save it to a file on the hard drive), at which point you should press the `Y` key to answer yes. Nano will now ask you whether you want to use the file name _run.nex_; this time just press Enter to accept. Nano should now exit and you can use cat to look at the contents of the file you just created:

    cat run.nex

####  Create the gopaup file 

Now use nano to create a second file named _gopaup_ in your _pauprun_ directory. To do this, type `pwd` to make sure you are in the _pauprun_ directory, then type `nano gopaup`. This file should contain this text:

    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --partition=mcbstudent
    #SBATCH --qos=mcbstudent 
    #SBATCH --job-name=pauprun
    cd $HOME/pauprun
    module load paup/4.0a-166
    paup -n run.nex

## Downloading files to the cluster

The next three sections describe **three different ways** to get a file into a directory on the cluster. If the file is located on a website, which is the usual case for labs in this course, **I would use the curl method**. If you don't like that method, the other two sections offer alternative ways (both of which involve first getting the file onto your local computer, then uploading it to the cluster).

###   Using curl to download the algae.nex data file directly 

One of my favorite methods to transfer files that are stored on a web site involves the program curl (which stands for copy url). The following command should be carried out in a terminal that _is already logged into the cluster_.

In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to save the file (on the cluster). Use this command to download the _algae.nex_ file directly into the present working directory on the cluster:

    curl -Ok http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/people/plewis/downloads/algae.nex

The `-O` tells curl to save it under the same file name (algae.nex) that it has on the remote server. If you forget the `-O`, curl will just spit out the entire contents of the file to your terminal, which is almost never what you want! The `k` in `-Ok` tells `curl` to go ahead even if it does not recognize the security certificate issued by the server hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu. Hydrodictyon uses a valid InCommon SSL certificate generated by UConn UITS, but InCommon is not recognized by the `curl` program on Xanadu.

If this method worked, skip now to the section [A few more UNIX commands](#a-few-more-unix-commands)

###  Using Cyberduck to upload the algae.nex data file 

Download the file [algae.nex](http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/people/plewis/downloads/algae.nex) and save it on your hard drive.

Open Cyberduck, choose `Bookmark > New Bookmark` from the main menu, then fill out the resulting dialog box as shown on the right (except substitute your own user name, of course). Be sure to change the protocol to SFTP (not the default FTP). Click the button to close the dialog box and you should see your bookmark appear at the bottom of the main window. Double click the bookmark to open a connection. You will then be warned that the host key is unknown - choose Allow (and go ahead and check the Always button so you do not need to do this every time.

![Creating a bookmark in Cyberduck](/assets/img/Cyberduck-bookmark-xanadu.png) 

Once you are in, you will see a listing of the files in your home directory on the cluster. To copy the `algae.nex` file to the cluster, you need only drag-and-drop it onto the Cyberduck window.

If this method worked, skip now to the section [A few more UNIX commands](#a-few-more-unix-commands)

###   Using scp to upload the algae.nex data file 

Download the file [algae.nex](http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/people/plewis/downloads/algae.nex) and save it on your hard drive.

The following should be carried out in a terminal that _is_ **not** _already logged into the cluster_.

In your terminal, navigate to where you saved the file (on your local Mac or Windows computer). If you saved it on the desktop, you can go there by typing `cd Desktop`.

If you've made a shortcut in your _.ssh/config_ file, you can use the following command to upload the _algae.nex_ file to the cluster:

    scp algae.nex xfer:

If you have not made a shortcut, use this command instead:

    scp algae.nex username@transfer.cam.uchc.edu:

where `username` should be replaced by your own user name on the cluster. (Don't overlook the colon on the very end of the line!)

###  A few more UNIX commands 

You have now transferred a data file (_algae.nex_) to the cluster, but it may not be in the right place. Use the `pwd` and `cd` commands to ensure that you are in the _pauprun_ directory, then type `ls` to see if the _algae.nex_ file is there. The _run.nex_ file contains a line containing the command `execute algae.nex`, which means that _algae.nex_ should also be located in the _pauprun_ directory. 

####  mv command: moving or renaming a file 

If _algae.nex_ is in your home directory, you can use the `mv` command to move it to the directory _pauprun_:

    cd
    mv algae.nex pauprun

The `mv` command takes two arguments. The first argument is the name of the directory or file you want to move, whereas the second argument is the destination. The destination could be either a directory (which is true in this case) or a file name. If the directory _pauprun_ did not already exist, `mv` would have interpreted this as a request to rename _algae.nex_ to the file name _pauprun_! So, be aware that `mv` can rename files as well as move them.

####  cp command: copying a file 

The `cp` command copies files. It leaves the original file in place and makes a copy elsewhere. You could have used this command to make a copy of _algae.nex_ in the directory _pauprun_:

    cp algae.nex pauprun

This would have left the original in your home directory, and made a duplicate of this file in the directory _pauprun_.

####  rm command: cleaning up 

The `rm` command removes files. If you had used the `cp` command to copy _algae.nex_ into the _pauprun_ directory, you could remove the original file using these commands:

    cd
    rm algae.nex

The first `cd` command just ensures that the copy you are removing will be the one in your home directory. The variable `$HOME` holds the path to your home directory. The symbol `~` is shorthand for `$HOME`. Typing `cd` by itself, `cd ~`, or `cd $HOME` all change the present working directory to `$HOME`. 
To delete an entire directory (don't try this now!), you can add the `-rf` flags. The `r` flag tells `rm` to recursively apply the remove command to everything in every subdirectory, while the `f` flag means force (don't ask whether each file should be deleted in each subdirectory, just do it!):

    rm -rf pauprun

The above command would remove everything in the _pauprun_ directory (without asking!), and then remove the _pauprun_ directory itself. I want to stress that this is a **particularly dangerous command**, so make sure you are not distracted or sleep-deprived when you use it! Unlike the Windows or Mac graphical user interface, files deleted using rm are **not** moved to the Recycle Bin or Trash, they are just gone. There is **no undo** for the rm command.

###  Starting a PAUP* analysis 

If you've been following the directions in sequence, you now have two files (_algae.nex_ and _run.nex_) in your `$HOME/pauprun` directory on the cluster, whereas the _gopaup_ file should be in `$HOME`. Use the `cd` command to make sure you are in your home directory, then the `cat` command to look at the contents of the _gopaup_ file you created earlier. You should see this: 

    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --partition=mcbstudent 
    #SBATCH --qos=mcbstudent
    #SBATCH --job-name=pauprun
    cd $HOME/pauprun
    module load paup/4.0a-166
    paup -n run.nex

This file will be used by software called SLURM to start your run. SLURM provides a command called `sbatch` that you will use to submit your analysis. The SLURM `sbatch` command will look for a core (i.e. processor) on a node (i.e. machine) in the cluster that is currently not being used and will start your analysis on that node. This saves you the effort of looking amongst all nodes in the cluster for a core that is not busy.

Here is an explanation of each of the lines in _gopaup_:
* The 1st line specifies the command interpreter to use (just include this in your scripts verbatim).
* The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th lines begin with `#SBATCH` and are interpreted as commands by SLURM itself. In this case, the first and second `#SBATCH` commands tell SLURM to use the general partition (`--partition=mcbstudent`) and the general quality of service (`--qos=mcbstudent`). You should always include these two lines verbatim. The last `#SBATCH` line gives a name to your job (`--job-name=pauprun`). You could change `pauprun` here to something else, but keep your job names short and without embedded spaces or punctuation. The job name will help you identify your run when checking status.
* The 5th line is simply a `cd` command that changes the present working directory to the _pauprun_ directory you created earlier. This will ensure that anything saved by PAUP* ends up in this directory rather than in your home directory. 
* The 6th line informs the system that you want to use a particular version of paup. If you left this line out, the command on the last line might not work at all, or might run an older version of paup. You can get a list of all available modules using the command `module avail`.
* The 7th and last line starts up PAUP* and executes the _run.nex_ file. The `-n` flag tells PAUP* that no human is going to be listening or answering questions, so it should just use default answers to any questions it needs to ask during the run.

####  Submitting a job using sbatch 

Now you are ready to start the analysis. Type these commands to start your run:

    cd
    cd pauprun
    sbatch gopaup

####  Checking status using squeue 

You can see if your run is still going using the squeue command:

    squeue

If it is running, you will see an entry named pauprun. Here is what it looked like for me:

    hpc-ext-2 pauprun $ squeue
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
            645170   general  pauprun   plewis PD       0:00      1 (Priority)

The PD under ST (state) means that my job is pending (not yet running). This job goes so fast that you will be lucky to find it in the running state. If you see no jobs listed when you run squeue, it means your job has finished.

####  Killing a job using scancel 

Sometimes it is clear that an analysis is not going to do what you wanted it to. Suppose that just after you press the Enter key to start an analysis, you realize that you forgot to put in a savetrees command in your paup block (so in the end you will not be able to see the results of the search). In such situations, you really want to just kill the job, fix the problem, and then start it up again. Use the `scancel` command for this. Note that in the output of the `squeue` command above, my run had a job-ID equal to 645170. I could kill the job like this:

    scancel 645170

Be sure to delete any output files that have already been created before starting your run over again.

####  While PAUP* is running 

While PAUP* is running, you can use `cat` to look at the log file:

    cd pauprun
    cat algae.output.txt

####   Using Cyberduck to download the log file and the tree file 

When PAUP* finishes, `squeue` will no longer list your process. At this point, you need to use Cyberduck or `scp` to get the log and tree files that were saved back to your local computer. Assuming you left Cyberduck open and connected to the cluster, double-click on the _pauprun_ directory and locate the files `algae.ml.tre` and  `algae.output.txt`. Select these two files and drag them out of the Cyberduck window and drop them on your desktop. After a flurry of activity, Cyberduck should report that the two files were downloaded successfully, at which point you can close the download status window.

####  Using scp to download the log file and the tree file 

You can also use `scp` to get the log and tree files that were saved back to your local computer, but, again, if you are happy with Cyberduck you can skip this section. In the Terminal app on your Mac (or the Git for Windows BASH session on your Windows PC), type the following (being careful to separate the final dot character from everything else by a blank space):

    scp xfer:pauprun/algae.output.txt .
    scp xfer:pauprun/algae.ml.tre .

This assumes you have set up a shortcut: if not, you will need to use the longer version below (being sure to replace `username` with your own user name on the cluster):

    scp username@transfer.cam.uchc.edu:pauprun/algae.output.txt .
    scp username@transfer.cam.uchc.edu:pauprun/algae.ml.tre .

These `scp` commands copy the files `algae.output.txt` and `algae.ml.tre` to your current directory (this is what the single dot at the end of each line stands for).

###  Using FigTree to view tree files 

{% include figure.html description="`algae.ml.tre` file viewed with FigTree" url="/assets/img/AlgaeMLtree.png" css="image-right noborder" width="400px" %}

If you do not already have it, download and install the [FigTree](https://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) application on your laptop. FigTree is a Java application, so you will also need to install a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) if you don't already have one (just start FigTree and it will tell you if it cannot find a JRE). Once FigTree is running, choose File > Open from the menu to open the `algae.ml.tre` file.

####  Adjusting taxon label font 

The first thing you will probably want to do is make the taxon labels larger or change the font. Expand the Tip Labels section on the left and play with the Font Size up/down control. You can also set font details in the preferences, which will save you a lot of time in the future

####  Line thickness 

You can modify the thickness of the lines used by FigTree to draw the edges of the tree by expanding the Appearance tab.

####  Ladderization 

You can ladderize the tree (make it appear to flow one way or the other) by playing with the Order Nodes option in the Trees tab.

####  Export tree as PDF 

There are many other options that you can discover in FigTree, but one more thing to try today is to save the tree as a PDF file. Once you have the tree looking just the way you want, choose File > Export PDF...

####  Why have PAUP* create the log file algae.output.txt? 

In your _pauprun_ directory, SLURM saved the output that PAUP* normally sends to the console to a file named _slurm-645170.out_ (your file will have a different number, however). You will not need this file after the run: the log command in your paup block ends up saving the same output in the file _algae.output.txt_. Why did we tell PAUP* to start a log file if SGE was going to save the output anyway? The main reason is that you can view the log file during the run, but you cannot view _slurm-645170.out_ until the run is finished. There will come a day when you have a PAUP* run that has been going for several days and want to know whether it is 10% or 90% finished. At this point you will appreciate being able to view the output file!

####  Delete the slurm-xxxx.out file using the rm command 

Because you do not need the _slurm-xxxxx.out_ file (where _xxxx_ is a placeholder for the job number), delete it using the `rm` command (the `-f` stands for force; i.e. don't ask if it is ok, just do it!):

    cd
    cd pauprun
    rm -f slurm-*.out

You also no longer need the log and tree files because you downloaded them to your local computer using PSFTP:

    rm -f algae.ml.tre
    rm -f algae.output.txt

It is a good idea to delete files you no longer need for two reasons:
* you will later wonder whether you downloaded those files to your local machine and will have to spend time making sure you actually have saved the results locally
* our cluster only has so much disk space, and thus it is just not possible for everyone to keep every file they ever created

###  Tips and tricks 

Here are some miscellaneous tips and tricks to make your life easier when communicating with the cluster.

####  Command completion using the tab key 

You can often get away with only typing the first few letters of a filename; try pressing the Tab key after the first few letters and the command interpreter will try to complete the thought. For example, cd into the pauprun directory, then type

    cat alg<TAB>

If _algae.nex_ is the only file in the directory in which the first three letters are alg, then the command interpreter will type in the rest of the file name for you.

####  Wildcards 

I've already mentioned this tip, but it bears repeating. When using most UNIX commands that accept filenames (e.g. `ls`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp`), you can place an asterisk inside the filename to stand in for any number of letters. So

    ls algae*

will produce output like this

    algae.ml.tre    algae.nex   algae.output.txt

####  Man pages 

If you want to learn more options for any of the UNIX commands, you can use the `man` command to see the manual for that command. For example, here's how to see the manual describing the ls command:

    man ls

It is important to know how to escape from a man page! The way to get out is to type the letter `q`. You can page down using Ctrl-f, page up through a man page using Ctrl-b, go to the end using Shift-g and return to the very beginning using 1,Shift-g (that is, type a 1, release it, then type Shift-g). You can also move line by line in a man page using the down and up arrows, and page by page using the PgUp and PgDn keys.

####  Xanadu information 

You can find a lot of great information about the Xanadu cluster at the [Computational Biology Core](https://bioinformatics.uconn.edu/) web site. In particular, take time to look through the first tutorial named "Understanding the UConn Health Cluster (Xanadu)".
