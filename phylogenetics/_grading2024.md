## Homeworks

This course involves weekly **homework assignments** that you are expected to complete **without consulting with other students**, but you are welcome (encouraged!) to consult with the instructors. Some homework assignments will involve hand calculations (using an actual or online calculator), some will involve a small amount of computer programming in Python and R (but note that no previous programming background is assumed), and others will involve small projects that require you to understand how to set up software such as RevBayes to carry out an analysis, and then report on what you found.

## Labs

Labs involve self-paced tutorials designed to teach you how to use important phylogenetics software packages and how to carry out analyses remotely using the Xanadu cluster. For each lab you will need to turn in something to demonstrate that you worked through the lab exercise.

## Participation

The course will be to some degree "flipped" in that I will assign reading from the textbook or papers from the literature and expect you to have read it before lecture. You receive participation credit for asking questions and participating in discussions about the material youâ€™ve read, or material presented in either lecture or lab. I realize not everyone is comfortable actively participating in class, so one or more questions may be submitted via email before lecture if that is better for you.

## Due Dates and Late Policy

Because there are no formal exams, term papers, or projects, it is important to not skip or get behind on the homework assignments. You will be given 1 week to complete a homework assignment. You are allowed to be up to one week late on at most 2 homework assignments during the semester without penalty; you will be given a zero on any homework assignment turned in more than 2 weeks after it is assigned.
