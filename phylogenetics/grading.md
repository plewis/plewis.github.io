Return to the [Phylogenetics (EEB 5349) main page](/phylogenetics2022/).

This course involves weekly **homework assignments** that you are expected to complete without consulting with other students (but you are welcome to consult with the instructors). Some homework assignments will involve hand calculations (using an actual or online calculator), some will involve a small amount of computer programming in Python and R (but note that no previous programming background is assumed), and others will involve small projects that require you to understand how to set up software such as RevBayes to carry out an analysis, and then report on what you found. There are no formal exams, term papers, or projects, only homeworks, so it is important to not skip or get behind on the homework assignments. 

**Labs** involve self-paced tutorials designed to teach you how to use important phylogenetics software packages and how to carry out analyses remotely using the Xanadu cluster. For each lab you will need to turn in something to demonstrate that you worked through the lab exercise. You will get participation points for what you turn in.
